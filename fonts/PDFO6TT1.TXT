The fonts use VISCII 1.1 encoding by Viet-Std, and can be used with any 
application that uses VISCII fonts.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
0) Erase the old version of these fonts if you have them installed previously.
   First, click on the "Control" icon, then "ABC" , then when a panel listing
   the available fonts appears, select the old font, then select delete. If 
   you don't delete the old font , there is a chance that because of the fonts
   having the same name, the old font will always get selected.
  
2) Make a directory , for ex. VNFONTS:
     C:
     MKDIR C:\VNFONTS
   then change to that directory:
     CD C:\VNFONTS
3) Copy the file from the floppy:
     COPY B:pdfo6tt1.EXE C:
     or copy b:pdfo6tt1.zip c: if you have the zip file.
   and run it to extract the fonts:
     C:pdfo6tt1 <Enter> or pkunzip pdfo6tt1.zip

4) Run Windows. Then double click on the Control icon. It will
   pop up a panel.  Look for the icon "ABC" (for fonts), then
   double click on this icon.  This in turn will pop up another
   window, with panes showing what fonts are currently installed.
   Click on the "Add" button, then select the directory containing 
   the Vietnamese fonts. The fonts' names will be displayed on a 
   panel. Click on a font name and "OK" to install it.  Repeat this 
   procedure for the other font names. Then close the Control window.

5) To use Vietnamese fonts in a Windows application, select the font 
   and use it.

6) To type in Vietnamese for any Windows application, you need the programs
   WinVNKey or VietVU by TriChlor.  Or you can generate a VISCII file 
   under DOS using VietDos/vnelvis, VPS, butviet, etc., and read in that file
   from the Windows application. Commercial VN software such as T-Script by 
   TIEN can also read and write in VISCII.  Or if you have no access to 8-bit 
   tools, you can write in Viet-Net/SCV/VIQR style, and use the program 
   viet7to8 to convert it to VISCII.
   For "Write", make sure you select "No conversion".
   For Microsoft Word, choose the "Text only" filter.
   Then select the whole text, and change to Vietnamese fonts.
   Also see the note about Hoa font below.

7) To print is easy. Just click on print. Any printer supported by Windows 
   will print Vietnamese.

8) To print on a Unix network PostScript printer: in Windows, select a 
   PostScript printer, then select "Print to File".  Return to the program, 
   start printing.  A window will pop up and ask you for a file name. 
   Enter a file name.  Transfer this file to Unix (using ftp or whatever), 
   then just print it (lpr filename).

The HOA (uppercase) fonts
=========================
Each typeface comes with 2 fonts, a normal font and a HOA font,
with the HOA font name ended in H. For example:
     UHoai   : normal font, both lowercase and uppercase chars.
     UHoaiH  : HOA font, all uppercase characters.

In order to produce some of the uppercase chars, particularly the ones 
coded in C0 ( A(? A(~ A^~ Y? Y~ Y. ), you may need to switch to the 
corresponding HOA font for each of the typeface, for some applications.  
Basically, in the HOA font, all the chars are capital (uppercase), so if 
you type "a?" you will get "A?", or select "a?" in the text, and switch 
to HOA font to get "A?".  The reason is Vietnamese has 134 chars, and 
usable slots are less than 128 :-( . VISCII 1.1 has been designed so that 
all lowercase chars and most uppercase chars are usable by most existing 
software. Some software uses certain Vietnamese chars for their internal 
purpose, most of the time in the uppercase area.  Therefore, when one 
wants to produce certain uppercase using these software, just switch to 
HOA font.  Each font comes with a normal font, and a HOA font to alleviate
this problem. Normally, the normal font should take care of most of your 
needs.

Have fun writing !
